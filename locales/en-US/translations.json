To sell cryptocurrency, you need to first despoit assets to your CoinCola wallet. <br>Step 2<br>Go to the main page and select the SELL tab on the nav bar. Fill in the form and choose a payment method. <br>Note about payment methods: Some payment methods are considered high-risk. Cryptocurrency transactions are completely irreversible. Once you sell your cryptocurrency it won't be possible for you to recover them, even if the buyer's payment is reversed. We recommend you choose a low risk payment method and to favour experienced users with a large amount of previous trades and postivie reviews.<br>Step 3<br>Pick one advertisement from the list where the trader has a good reputation score and a high amount of completed trades. You can click the sell button to view more information about an advertisement.<br>Step 4<br>After you press the Sell button, you'll see more information about the advertisement, including the terms of the trade. Read through them carefully before submitting the trade request, and if you disagree with them, you can come back to the previous listing page and choose another advertisement. <br>To start the trade, enter the amount you want to sell, enter a message for the buyer and click the trade request button to start the trade.<br>Once you start the trade, your cryptocurrency will be moved from your CoinCola wallet to the trade escrow.<br>Step 5<br>Once you've sent the order request, the buyer will ask you for your payment details (e.g. if you want to sell and receive funds via a bank transfer, the buyer will ask for your bank account information). After you have given the seller the payment information, the buyer will pay for the cryptocurrency and confirm it has been sent. <br>Please make sure that you have received the money into your account before releasing the cryptocurrency. Never release the cryptocurrency before you have received the payment. Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, once you send the cryptocurrency to the buyer there is no way to get them back, even if the buyers payment doesn't show up. <br>Once you have confirmed that the payment has been made, you can select the 'Release' cryptocurrency button. This will send the cryptocurrency from the trade escrow to the buyer's wallet and complete the trade.<br>",

That's why it is important to never release the cryptocurrency from the escrow until you receive the payment. Even if they are a regular buyer or someone you know, it can be risky as once the cryptocurrency has been released from the escrow since there is no way for you to recover the assets. <br>With reversible payments, scammers will attempt to pay using stolen credentials or purchase proof. You can require the buyer to have their identity verified on their CoinCola account, and then check if the user's real name matches the name of the payment account to avoid these scams. <br>If you ever encounter a suspicious user, you can always open a dispute for the trade and the CoinCola support team will help to resolve the situation.<br>",
  "order_faq_sell_content_3": "Fraudulent buyers are often in a hurry. The more a customer asks you to hurry or rush, the more suspicious you should be. Our real customers always have patience. <br>Fraudulent buyers often suggest doing all or a part of the transaction outside the escrow and then do not complete their part of the transaction. <br>Be careful about photoshopped payment evidence, don't release cryptocurrency until you have confirmed that you have received the money. You are not obliged to release a trade until you can verify that you have received the buyer's payment. <br>Don't open any links that your trading partner is sending to you. If you must, use different browser than the one you are usually using. <br>Don't visit websites other than CoinCola with the same browser that you're using to trade. Use a different browser to navigate on other websites. <br>Bookmark CoinCola in your browser and always use the bookmark when visiting the website. This helps you to avoid accidentally visiting phishing websites. They exist and can be very convincing. Even experienced traders have fallen victim to phishing websites. <br>If you're unsure about a user, you can always contact CoinCola support for help.<br>",

If there was a mistake, you can re-open the trade to finish the trade with the buyer. <br>If there is any disagreement during the trade, you can open a dispute. After a dispute has been started, you can still release the cryptocurrency and finish the trade (e.g. in the case of a payment taking longer than usual to arrive and a dispute was opened prematurely). <br>Not replying to trade offers can give you negative feedback.
